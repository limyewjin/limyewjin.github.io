Successful growth requires a holistic approach that addresses every stage of the funnel.</li> <li>Growth is a war of attrition, where you must systematically optimize and improve each piece of the growth funnel over time. This requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to experiment and iterate.</li> <li>Getting many things right requires a long-term perspective. Sustainable growth is not achieved overnight but through consistent effort and optimization over time.</li> </ul> <h1 id="logistics-wins-growth">Logistics wins growth</h1> <ul> <li>“Infantry wins battles, logistics wins wars.” - John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force in Europe during World War I</li> <li>“Logistics wins growth too.” - Yew Jin Lim</li> <li>In the context of growth, “logistics” refers to the data infrastructure, experimentation platforms, analytics, and even the organizational set up, including cross-functional collaborations.</li> <li>Growth is a team sport, and organizations need to break down silos and foster strong partnerships between teams such as product, engineering, data science, UX, and more.</li> <li>Does your organization track growth?</li> <li>Does it measure itself against growth?</li> <li>How does the team learn about progress towards growth? It’s not just the leads, it’s everyone on the team should be thinking and tracking towards what works, and what doesn’t.</li> <li>Are you involving cross-functional partners such as data science, program management, UX design, UX research, and others?</li> </ul> <p>Share your experiences and insights in the comments below!</p> <p>Remember, logistics wins growth!</p> </body></html>
