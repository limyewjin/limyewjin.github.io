Many of you were intrigued by the first step, ‘Know Thyself’.</p> <p>Having spent years in Big Tech, I’ve seen how essential self-awareness is to career growth. Let me break it down:</p> <p>A. Understanding Who You Are Now It’s about honest self-reflection: accepting your strengths and weaknesses. This goes beyond your resume. Genuine self-awareness creates the confidence needed to pursue goals aligned with your strengths.</p> <p>Examine the gap between how others perceive you and how you see yourself. Ask yourself:</p> <ul> <li>“What do my colleagues see as my strengths?”</li> <li>“Where do they think I could improve?”</li> </ul> <p>Solicit feedback. These moments of disconnection—or alignment—are golden opportunities. I remember being told as a TLM, “Stop trying to code, you’re blocking the team…” That’s when I knew I should focus on engineering management. On the other hand, folks often tell me they enjoy my creative approach to problems, and I enjoy riffing on ideas and building new things (ask me about my LLM-powered e-ink display of bad jokes!)</p> <p>Performance programs like GRAD at Google are valuable sources of information. Don’t shy away from introspection. This step is hard. It demands that you dig in and find yourself.</p> <p>B. Understanding Who You Want to Be Forget about a perfect 10-year plan. This is about active exploration. Clarity comes from action.</p> <p>Instead of waiting to become the leader I aspired to be, I started embodying those qualities early on. I was already contributing to architectural decisions, mentoring, and taking ownership. This “act as if” approach is about growing into your aspirations. Want to be seen as a leader? Volunteer to lead a project or mentor a new hire. Aspire to be a technical expert? Deep dive into a tech and share your knowledge. Do, don’t ask. (or at least make it asking for forgiveness)</p> <p>C. Understanding How to Get There The bridge between who you are and who you want to be is built through strategic action.</p> <p>Your path doesn’t have to be revolutionary – it needs to be authentic. Sometimes, the best opportunities exist within your current role. This might involve seeking a mentor, identifying projects that align with your goals, or investing in your development.</p> <p>Remember that growth isn’t always linear. Stay focused on your goals and remain adaptable.</p> <p>The Most Important Question</p> <p>“What energizes me most?” This emerged through years of paying attention to what activities left me feeling fulfilled. For a while, I did a ton of “what the business needed,” and it left me drained. This isn’t about a perfect plan; it’s about understanding your motivations.</p> <p>When you align your strengths with your aspirations and find opportunities that energize you, work becomes a path to continuous growth.</p> <p>Take some time to reflect. What energizes you? Where do you want to go?</p> <p>Now go do it.</p> <p>https://yewjin.com/blog/2022/software-engineering-managing/</p> </body></html>
