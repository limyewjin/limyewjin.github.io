Building from my last post - here are three key behaviors keep emerging from my experiences, both from my own and from observing teammates who do well - patterns that turned good work into meaningful change.</p> <p>First, it’s about constantly finding ways to be more valuable. The biggest breakthroughs happened when I looked beyond my job description and asked “what really matters here?” Sometimes the most important work wasn’t officially assigned to anyone. By focusing on what the organization truly needed, rather than just checking boxes, I found opportunities to make a lasting difference.</p> <p>Second, I learned that impact isn’t about titles – it’s about stepping up when needed. The times I’m most proud of and when I see others do well weren’t when they had formal authority, but when they tackled those persistent problems that everyone complained about but no one owned. Those ‘small’ issues that, left unaddressed, quietly drained team productivity day after day. Building trust with teammates, respecting their time and expertise, and sharing credit for wins – these were the real keys to leading effectively.</p> <p>Finally, there’s something powerful about being known as someone who finishes what they start. When challenges arise, it’s tempting to alert others and hope someone else handles them. But real impact comes from taking ownership and tackling problems head-on with resilience and determination. I’ve learned to prepare better by getting different perspectives early, being clear upfront about what support I need, and yes, sometimes knowing when to let go of something that’s not working.</p> <p>Looking back, these weren’t just random behaviors. They were deliberate choices about how to show up every day. The impact didn’t come from just working harder – it came from working differently, from seeing opportunities where others saw obstacles, and from staying committed even when things got tough.</p> </body></html>
