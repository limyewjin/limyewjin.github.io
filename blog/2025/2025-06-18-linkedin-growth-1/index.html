I am not trying to throw shade at your product.</li> <li>Small changes that impact a large audience at the top of the funnel can often yield better results than big changes targeting a smaller slice of traffic.</li> <li>Organizations must prioritize and focus on the most critical stages of the funnel to maximize their growth efforts.</li> </ul> <p>Do these resonate? Feel free to chat with me if you’re at Google for more (hard-fought) growth thoughts and examples on which these are based on.</p> </body></html>
