My name is Yew Jin, Lim. I am currently a Software Engineer at Google in its Mountain View campus. I received a Bachelors of Mathematics Double Honors Degree in Pure Mathematics and Computer Science (With Distinction) from the University of Waterloo in June 2000. I then returned to Singapore and entered into national service in July 2000. Upon completion of full-time national service in Nov 2002 as a naval officer, I enrolled in the National University of Singapore in Jan 2003 after receiving the A\*Star-NUS Graduate Fellowship. I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from the School of Computing, NUS, in September 2007. I joined Google in Nov 2007 and have worked in Search since then. I am a director of engineering in Search working on Proactive AI and Notifications.

I am interested in crypto and web3 - [yewjin.eth](https://app.ens.domains/name/yewjin.eth) directs here.

# Note about my name

In Asia, the standard template for names is reversed
i.e., [LAST NAME] [FIRST NAME]
To avoid any confusion, my last name is Lim. My first name is a double first name and basically consists of two separate words, Yew Jin, and when pronounced, sounds like "Eugene". In fact, over the years, I respond more readily to "Eugene" than the proper pronunciation of my name!

# Anecdote about my name

One of the most entertaining conversations in my life is with a school administrative officer from the University of Waterloo.

_Officer_: "Is you there?"<br>
_YJ_: "Yes, I am here."<br>
_Officer_: "You Lim?"<br>
_YJ_: "Yes, I am Lim."<br>
_silence_<br>
_Officer_: "Are you you Lim?"<br>
_YJ_: _realization_<br>
_YJ_: "Yes, I am Yew Lim."
