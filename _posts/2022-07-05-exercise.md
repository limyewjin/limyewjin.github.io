It's no secret that exercise is important for our overall health and well-being. But with our busy lives, it can be hard to find the time to fit it in. That's why it's great to know that a [new study](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-62040665) has found that we can get the same health benefits from exercising in short, intense bursts on the weekend as we can from spreading our activity out across the week.

So if you're looking to improve your health and reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, the findings suggest that it doesn't matter when you exercise, as long as you're getting at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week.

The study, which was published in the JAMA Internal Medicine journal, tracked 350,000 US adults over 10 years and found that those who reached the recommended level of activity had lower mortality rates, regardless of whether they exercised during the week or on the weekend.

So if you're short on time, a big burst of exercise on the weekend may be just as effective as spreading your activity out throughout the week. And if you're looking for ideas on how to get your 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, the NHS recommends brisk walking, light cycling, or doubles tennis as some options.

Just remember to breathe and have fun!
