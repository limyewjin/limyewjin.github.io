Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_i-wanted-to-share-something-personal-that-activity-7318439407835836416-JCpx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

I wanted to share something personal that’s been affecting me lately—and that I know many others quietly experience too. I've been noticeably absent from posting recently, and I want to be transparent about why: I've been experiencing burnout.

Thankfully, I caught it early. I’ve learned to recognize the signs and have been taking steps to address it.

Burnout isn’t just exhaustion—it often has layers. For me, it showed up in three ways:

- Overload: Taking on too much work or responsibility and pushing beyond capacity
- Value misalignment: Working on tasks misaligned with my values or interests
- Lack of rest: Not getting proper, restorative rest

Looking back, I realized I was experiencing early signs of all three at once. I felt overwhelmed by what I thought I had to carry, drained by things that didn’t energize me, and not allowing myself enough space to truly rest.

I’ve experienced significant burnout before, and whether it’s mild or severe, it tends to creep in—until it suddenly hits and leaves me disconnected from myself, others, and work.

It feels vulnerable sharing this, but I believe it's important to normalize these conversations.

Right now, I've been taking steps to reset—re-evaluating priorities, creating space for real rest, and focusing on the work that genuinely motivates me. If you're feeling the same, know you're not alone—and it's okay to pause, reset, and realign.
