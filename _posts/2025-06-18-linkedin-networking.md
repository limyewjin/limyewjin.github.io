Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_i-have-been-thinking-about-networking-lately-activity-7296606111887998976-N4uZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

I have been thinking about networking lately. I'll admit that I haven't been doing it intentionally and hadn't felt the need to do so - this post is a reflection on how I might want to approach it moving forward.

Most naturally, I want to continue "networking" by building genuine friendships instead of forcing connections.

What's fascinating is how our personality type shapes these relationships. Being aware of where you fall on the introversion-extroversion spectrum isn't about limiting yourself â€“ it's about leveraging your natural strengths. I am naturally a very introverted person socially, which might surprise folks who meet me at work (I'm quite loud at work, especially these days). But this contrast has taught me something important: success comes not from forcing yourself into a one-size-fits-all approach to professional relationships, but from building a style that works for you:

- Even writing LinkedIn posts has been illuminating for me - I have received appreciative notes (and feedback) about these posts; colleagues stop me in the hallway and comment about them (thank you!) - I actually find it easier to write than speak so I am appreciative that this forum exists that allows me to connect with you this way.
- Adapt your environment to match your social energy. Some days that means seeking out collaborative spaces, other days it means finding quiet corners for focused work. Knowing yourself means knowing when to engage and when to recharge.
- Look for mentors through genuine curiosity, not forced connections. The best mentoring relationships grow from authentic interactions and thoughtful questions, and don't have to be formal "will you be my mentor" arrangements. I have learnt so much from "mentors" without having formal arrangements by working, observing, and learning from others.
- Express gratitude consistently to those who make a difference. A simple thank you can transform a professional connection into a lasting relationship. This is something I need to do more of.

Your network doesn't have to be about collecting connections - it can be about cultivating real relationships with people who share your values and interests. These connections become more valuable over time not because of what they can do for you, but because of how you grow together. Or at least that's what I tell myself.

I'm interested in learning how to get better. Feel free to leave a note with thoughts and suggestions!
