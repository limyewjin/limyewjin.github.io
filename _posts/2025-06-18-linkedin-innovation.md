After years of leading innovation projects in big tech, here are three critical lessons I've learned about navigating the complexity:

1. Patience is required

- "Overnight successes" are typically month or years in the making
- The reality: Quick strategy → slow execution (and that's okay)
- But more often it's even: No clear strategy→ big goal, so we'll need to figure it out along the way!
- Focus on progress over perfection - overthinking kills momentum
- Key is measuring progress differently: track small wins, not just final outcomes
- Keep moving forward incrementally, especially in complex environments
- Build a culture where consistent progress beats endless planning

2. Keeping the team and leadership motivated

- The vision needs constant reinforcement - both up and down the org
- Use clear, memorable messaging to keep goals front-and-center
- Maintain a "brag doc" - it's not bragging, it's strategic communication
- Make progress visible and celebrate every milestone, no matter how small
- Connect each team member's work to the larger mission
- Pro tip: Your internal "marketing" needs to resonate with both your team and leadership - speak both languages (I need to learn to do this better myself!)

3. Navigate Organizational Debt

- Big tech = big organizational debt (it's inevitable)
- Think of it like tech debt: it compounds from avoided decisions
- Watch for the signs: outdated processes, delayed restructuring, excessive caution
- Don't waste energy fighting bureaucracy - it exists for a reason
- Instead, focus on maintaining momentum despite the constraints
- Empower your team to spot and solve inefficiencies
- Remember: Anyone at any level can drive progress with the right motivation

Innovation in big tech isn't just about breakthrough moments - it's about consistent forward motion and helping your team navigate complexity while staying focused on what truly matters.
