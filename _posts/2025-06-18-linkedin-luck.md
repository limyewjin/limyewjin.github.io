Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_i-used-to-think-i-was-just-a-lucky-person-activity-7303651365942173696-yQqN?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

I used to think I was just a "lucky" person. But lately I've been wondering - what is luck? Why am I "lucky"?

Looking back, I wonder if luck is at least partly mindset. When I strike up conversations with folks in the Micro Kitchen, or do an intro call with someone who reached out for advice on LinkedIn, I "happen" to meet valuable connections. When I follow my gut on decisions, they often work out. When I try new things without overthinking, unexpected opportunities emerge.

Even my setbacks have led to better outcomes - like learning from failed projects what I love (and didn’t love) to work on.

Maybe what we call luck is just:
• Being optimistic enough to put yourself out there
• Having a wide enough network and reputation to catch opportunities
• Staying relaxed enough to recognize good timing
• Being resilient enough to turn "bad luck" into something better

Do you consider yourself lucky? And what patterns might be creating that luck in your life?
