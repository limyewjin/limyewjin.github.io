Here's the fifth installment of the growth insights and execution series, focusing on High Value Actions.

# High Value Actions: The Secret to Driving User Engagement and Loyalty

Did you know that users who complete specific actions in your product are far more likely to become loyal, active users? These actions, known as High Value Actions, are the secret to maximizing engagement and unlocking long-term growth.

Examples of High Value Actions include subscribing to a newsletter, enabling push notifications, creating an account, making a purchase, or even sharing content within their network. These actions indicate a higher level of interest and commitment from the user, making them more likely to return and engage with the product repeatedly.

# Prioritize High Value Actions!

When presenting content to engage or re-engage a user, prioritize promoting High Value Actions over other types of content. This approach works because High Value Actions lead to sustained, long-term user engagement that drives growth. A key objective for user growth is to develop a diverse range of features or products that users can interact with through High Value Actions.

To leverage High Value Actions as a growth strategy, focus on:

1. Enhancing existing High Value Actions (e.g., expanding the range of newsletter topics users can subscribe to or improving the quality of content delivered through push notifications), and

2. Identifying and implementing new High Value Actions. This can be done by:

- Analyzing user behavior data to identify patterns and opportunities for new High Value Actions
- Conducting user research and surveys to understand user needs, preferences, and pain points
- etc.

Once new High Value Actions have been identified, it's crucial to effectively implement them by:

- Designing user-friendly, seamless experiences around the new High Value Actions - reduce friction!
- Clearly communicating the value and benefits of the new High Value Actions to users
- Providing any necessary onboarding, education, or support to help users successfully complete the new High Value Actions
- Monitoring and optimizing the performance of the new High Value Actions over time

# Real-World Examples of High Value Actions

- LinkedIn: Endorsing skills, making recommendations, and sharing content are High Value Actions that increase user engagement and network effects on the platform.
- Spotify: Creating playlists, sharing songs, and following artists are High Value Actions that help the platform better understand user preferences and deliver personalized recommendations.
- Duolingo: Completing lessons, setting daily goals, and inviting friends are High Value Actions that encourage consistent language learning and boost user retention.

By consistently offering valuable opportunities for users to take high value actions, products and features can foster a loyal and engaged user base, driving long-term growth and success!
