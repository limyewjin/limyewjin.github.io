description: Three principles for sustainable project success: embracing iteration over revolution, prioritizing impact before exploration, and planning thoroughly while executing adaptively.

I wanted to share three principles that have consistently guided how I approach projects:

- Embrace the power of iteration over revolution. I've learned that sustainable success rarely comes from "moonshots." Instead, I focus on consistent, incremental improvements - "roofshots." Each iteration builds on the last, creating a compound effect that's both reliable and powerful. It's about making measurable progress every single day, rather than waiting for that one breakthrough moment. Even with bold ideas, I push for quick demos to validate the approach before scaling. Learning fast beats guessing big.

- Impact before exploration. Every project serves one of two goals: delivering impact or opening doors for future innovation. But impact comes first. High-impact work earns the space and resources to explore new frontiers, ensuring we solve today’s problems while preparing for tomorrow’s.

- Plan thoroughly, execute adaptively. Strategy and roadmaps are critical, but reality rarely unfolds as planned. The key? Invest in planning, but stay flexible enough to pivot when new data demands it.

Isn't it about “move fast and break things?” Maybe in some cases. But I’ve found that consistent, thoughtful progress—paired with strategic exploration and adaptive planning—has led to more sustainable and meaningful outcomes for my team and me.

And the most important thing? Get started and keep going.
