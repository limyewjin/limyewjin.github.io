You know what makes tough projects better? A dash of silliness and bad jokes while having a chat over tea time.

Bringing joy to work isn't about waiting for the big wins or team building events. It's about the small moments - sharing bad jokes in meetings, celebrating mini-milestones with ridiculous memes or emojis, or calling out a bad situation with some levity. I like to share my artisanally curated set of bad jokes in a document titled "Dadabase".

Yes, we tackle serious challenges. Yes, we have ambitious goals. But who says we can't smile while doing it?

Some of my favorite workdays aren't when we crushed a huge deadline - they're when we're having silly commentary about a project, sharing bad jokes and laughter, and exchanging smiles as we pass each other in the hallway.

Being professional doesn't mean being serious all the time. Sometimes the best solutions come when we're relaxed enough to think creatively and laugh together.

What makes you smile at work?
