I've been thinking about defining moments lately - those experiences that shape who we are and what we become.

As I watch the AI revolution unfold, I can't help but be reminded of when I first joined Google in 2007, thinking that I missed the boat with the whole "make information universally accessible" dream. Some feel overwhelmed and left behind, worried their expertise will be rendered obsolete. Others see unprecedented opportunity.

The truth? This is our defining moment. The other time I felt this compelled was the emergence of Deep Learning, but while that felt like a step up, it didn't feel like a step change.

We don't need AGI for this transformation to fundamentally change how we work and create. The tools available today are already reshaping industries in ways that seemed impossible just months ago.

Yes, there's fear. Yes, there's uncertainty. Voice actors seeing work dry up, analysts watching their roles automated, creative professionals questioning their future, software engineers no longer needed to code up projects.

But remember: defining moments aren't just about elevation and surprise. They're about insight, pride, and connection. They're about discovering something new about yourself and the world.

We get to decide:

- Will we create the future or just wait for it?
- Will we ride this exponential wave or be swept away by it?
- Will we find meaning in the transformation or only see what's being lost?

The chaos and uncertainty we're experiencing now is the birthplace of innovation.

This moment isn't just happening to us - we're happening to it. We're shaping it.

Ten, maybe even just five or less, years from now, we'll look back at this period with 20/20 clarity. The question is: will you remember it as the time you stepped up and helped define how these technologies serve humanity? Or as the moment that passed you by?

Choose to make this your defining moment. The future is calling.
