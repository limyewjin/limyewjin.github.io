AI is everywhere. Whether we like it or not, it's shaping the way we work, learn, and communicate. But while many of us are focused on how to use AI effectively, we're not asking a more fundamental question: do we really understand what we're dealing with?

I just discovered "The Bullshit Machines" by two UW professors - a free online course that's not about teaching you how to use LLMs, and I find myself liking it more than I expected (modulo the website interaction format). Instead, it's a thoughtful examination of how to thrive in a world where AI-generated content is becoming indistinguishable from human-created work.

What struck me most was their focus on the human element. While AI can help us ship code faster, write better docs, and streamline communication, it's crucial to understand its limitations:

- AI doesn't "think" or "reason" like we do. It generates text based on probabilities—not understanding. Ask it why men get the flu worse than women, then ask the opposite. You'll get two confident, contradictory answers.
- The real value isn't in replacing human thinking, but in augmenting it. AI can help brainstorm solutions and explore options, but the critical decisions—system design, business strategy, team leadership—still require human judgment.
- The biggest challenge isn't technical, it's epistemological. In a world where generating convincing misinformation is as easy as pressing a button, how do we know what's real?

I'm a daily AI user and firmly believe it's transforming how we work - engineers using AI will outperform those who don't. But it's not just about using these tools—it's about understanding both their potential and their pitfalls. That understanding might be what separates those who thrive with AI from those who merely use it.
