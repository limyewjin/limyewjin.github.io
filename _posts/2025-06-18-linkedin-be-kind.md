In our professional life, we often encounter situations where we can choose to be kind, or not. While being authentic matters, we must make conscious choices about when to show kindness and where to direct our energy.

I've learned that genuine kindness builds lasting relationships, but it must be paired with strategic focus to create meaningful impact.

Be kind, but be smart.

The key to being kind at work isn't just being nice—it's creating the right environment for both kindness and success to flourish:

- Surround yourself with like-minded and ethical people who share your values. Your environment shapes your experience and also your opportunities for growth and impact.
- Master the art of self-promotion. Kind people often struggle to highlight their achievements, but visibility is crucial for career advancement. Don't let modesty hold you back.
- Set clear, firm boundaries. When someone tries to take advantage of your kindness, address it directly. Kindness without boundaries isn't sustainable.
- Practice selective forgiveness. Everyone makes mistakes, including you. Second chances can transform relationships—when given thoughtfully.

Working Hard at the Right Things

Success isn't just about persistence and just working hard—it's about being selective with where you direct your energy. The key is knowing when to persist and when to pivot:

- Test your interests through small experiments before committing fully
- Be intentional in what you are doing: ask yourself if this is what you want, and then ask if it’s not what it is that isn’t working and how you might get there
- Focus your efforts on endeavors that truly matter to your long-term goals
- Quit activities that don't align with your primary objectives—this creates space for what matters. We are always trading off the precious little time that we have.

Remember: Success isn't about working harder than everyone else or being the nicest person in the room. It's about working hard on the right things while being kind in the right way.
