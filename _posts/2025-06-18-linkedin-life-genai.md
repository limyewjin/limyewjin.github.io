Trigger Warning: This post discusses perspectives on mortality and life's meaning

As a Buddhist, I've found that contemplating death has paradoxically taught me how to live more fully. While many of us instinctively avoid thinking about mortality, I've discovered that facing it directly can transform how we approach each day.

Growing up, I was no different – focusing on daily routines and pushing existential thoughts aside. But embracing my mortality has become a powerful lens through which I view time's preciousness, leading me to live with greater intention and purpose.

My meditation practice often explores the nature of self. Beyond Buddhist concepts of no-self, what's fascinated me most is how making peace with death has deepened my appreciation for life's vivid moments.

I find profound teachers in life's small impermanences – a wilting bouquet, a well-worn favorite shirt, and watching my kids grow into young adults. These daily reminders of transience have taught me to fully inhabit the present rather than just passing through it.

Accepting mortality has clarified what makes a life well-lived: the dual pursuit of vitality and meaning. I've learned to prioritize work that ignites joy and curiosity, while nurturing relationships and activities aligned with my core values.

This perspective fuels my passion for transformative technologies, particularly Generative AI. Having worked in AI and machine learning throughout my career, I'm energized by its unprecedented potential to enhance how we live, learn, and create meaning. The rapid evolution of Gen AI has only made these possibilities more tangible and urgent.

Let's build something meaningful together.
