The uncomfortable truth about success? It requires courage to do what feels "wrong" by conventional standards - you have to swim against the current while others float downstream.

Growing up in Asia, I was culturally nudged to blend in, wait for permission, and never appear too pushy. Yet every breakthrough I've witnessed came from someone willing to risk being called "weird" or "self-centered." Thankfully I was always never good at listening. :-)

The fear of judgment keeps us playing small. We soften our messages, downplay our achievements, and wait for the perfect moment that never comes. Meanwhile, those who succeed aren't waiting - they're being authentically themselves, even when it makes others uncomfortable.

Real impact means advocating boldly for yourself and your team. It means asking the "obvious" question everyone else is too nervous to voice. It means choosing messy action over polished inaction, because perfection is indeed the enemy of the good or the inaction.

Yes, setting firm boundaries will make some people call you difficult. Being driven will get you labeled as pushy or unreasonable. But here's what I've learned: The same people who judge you today will praise your vision once you succeed. Stay humble through it all.

Our biggest regrets won't be the risks we took - they'll be the moments we chose comfort over courage. The times we had something valuable to contribute but stayed quiet. The opportunities we let pass while we were still "preparing."

Your unique perspective isn't something to hide. It's the very thing that will set you apart.

So remember:

- Be authentic, even if people find you odd - embrace the odd
- Prioritize action over perfection
- Advocate boldly for yourself and your team
- Be driven, curious, and firm
- Learn to be persuasive (even if you don't know how yet - it's the most impactful skill you'll ever develop)
- Be the person to lead the change
