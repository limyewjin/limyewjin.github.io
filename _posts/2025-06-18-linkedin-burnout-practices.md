Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_its-been-a-few-weeks-since-i-posted-and-activity-7329206012123455489-AyGn?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

It's been a few weeks since I posted and I wanted to share strategies that help me cope with not burning out while still valuing the work - AI continues to be moving at a fast pace and there is so much for us to get plug in and be part of the future!

- For me, a crucial first step has been identifying what delights versus what drains me. Tracking which tasks and interactions energize or deplete me has helped me recognize exactly where to set boundaries.

- I've started prioritizing work that genuinely excites me by asking: "What makes me lose track of time?" and "Which projects align with my values?" When we anchor our days in activities that spark enthusiasm, they become sustainable foundations rather than occasional bright spots.

- Building recovery rituals into my schedule has been essential. Those small breaks throughout the day aren't luxuries—they're necessities. Even 5 minutes to walk or breathe helps interrupt the stress cycle before it overwhelms.

- I practice emotional awareness through mindful observation. Rather than identifying with feelings ("I am stressed"), I notice them with curiosity ("There is stress present now"). Seeing emotions as experiences passing through awareness—not defining who I am—helps me respond from a centered place.

- Perhaps most importantly, I'm reconnecting with my professional identity not being me. Much of our suffering comes from attaching to any aspect of ourselves. When work becomes our primary source of meaning, challenges there can shake our entire foundation. By nurturing different facets of my life and remembering that no single role defines me, I've found a more balanced perspective that creates natural resilience to the inevitable ups and downs of work.

Take care of yourselves, friends.
