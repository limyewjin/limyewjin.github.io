Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_as-a-software-engineer-ive-learned-the-activity-7288605505604726785-osJ3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

As a software engineer, I've learned the hard way that details ≠ clarity. When communicating with executives, every extra word dilutes your message. Despite coaching and training, I still catch myself diving too deep and losing my audience – but recognizing this tendency and having the right tools has been helpful.

Three insights that changed how I communicate complex technical concepts:

- Lead with impact: Start with what matters most. For that exciting GenAI proposal? "This will transform how users experience our product" comes before any technical architecture.
- Context before complexity: Show why it matters before how it works. Your audience needs to care before they'll dig into details.
- Layer your message: Start high-level, then provide paths to technical depth. Not everyone needs your debugging journey.

The reality? In today's world, you have seconds to make your point. The clearer you communicate, the more influence you'll have. That’s not to say we shouldn’t have the details in our head. It’s just part of getting stuff done.
