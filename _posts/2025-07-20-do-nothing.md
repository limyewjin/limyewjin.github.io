description: Don't mistake being busy for being meaningful
---

Ever notice how "What are you working on?" is a default small talk opener?

We've created a world where every moment needs to be monetized, optimized, or leveraged for future gain. Even our hobbies are hyperoptimized now.

But here's what I'm learning: The most valuable things in life resist commodification.

- That hour spent watching birds in your backyard? Not wasted.
- Hiking for the scenery? Not wasted.
- Meditating through the morning? Not wasted.

When we only engage with what has "clear value," we lose context. We mistake being busy for being meaningful.

The real radical act might be refusing to optimize every experience. Sometimes the most productive thing you can do is sit still and notice what's actually around you.

Your attention is not a resource to be strip-mined. It's how you experience being alive.

Here's how I'm reclaiming mine:

- Notice when I'm being baited by clickbait or outrage - then choose to scroll past (hopefully not this post though? ðŸ˜‚)
- Learn the names of trees and birds in my neighborhood
- Strike up conversations with neighbors without an agenda
- Challenge myself when I feel guilty for "unproductive" time

Maybe it's time we stopped asking "What's the ROI?" and started asking "What makes me feel connected to the world?"

Maybe I'm becoming the old man yelling at clouds. But sometimes the clouds need yelling at. ðŸ¤£
