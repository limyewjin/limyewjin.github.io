I've been reflecting lately on the moments in my career where I've made the biggest impact. What made those situations different? What was my mindset going in?

First, belief was key. In the projects where I made the most impact, I truly believed I could shape the outcome. This wasn't just about being confident – it was about seeing every setback as a chance to learn and grow. When I doubted myself, I played it safe. I stuck to the original plan even when better paths emerged, and kept my thoughts to myself – I didn't believe I could influence the outcome.

Second, seeing the project from multiple angles made all the difference. I learned to look beyond my own role and understand what everyone involved really needed. What mattered to my teammates? To leadership? By understanding these unspoken needs, I could guide the project in better directions and help in ways that truly mattered.

Finally, I learned to see change differently. When plans shift or new challenges come up, I no longer see them as problems. Disruptions will always happen – that's just reality. But instead of seeing them as roadblocks, I now see them as chances to find better solutions. Some of our best work came from moments when we had to rethink our approach.

Looking back, were these wins just luck? Or was it being ready when opportunity knocked? I believe it wasn't random – a big part came down to how my team and I chose to face each challenge.
