I have been looking for ways to learn more about Web3 and content creating. And I recently stumbled upon a great platform called [showtime.xyz](https://showtime.xyz), which facilitates creators to upload and showcase their NFTs, digital and crypto art.

With showtime.xyz, I have found a way to not only learn more about Web3, but also to use AI artwork and mint NFTs to do it. As a bonus, I am able to find an excuse to create AI art.

Showtime.xyz mints NFTs on Polygon mainnet and gives them to users for free.

To make the most of the platform, I have been thinking about how to organize my artwork so that it is attractive and also creates buzz. I have also created token-gated access to new content so that there is incentive for people to engage with my work. Check out [showtime.xyz/yewjin](https://showtime.xyz/yewjin)
