The seventh installation of growth insights post -- looks like I still have more to say! Did you know that small changes in your product's copy can lead to massive improvements in user engagement and conversions? It's true! Copy experiments, or simply testing variations of text, images, and other elements, are an often overlooked but incredibly powerful tool and should be part of your growth toolkit and plans.

When I started working on growth, I was a skeptic about how impactful these changes could be, but we've seen jaw-dropping results over the years - 20% to over 50% improvements in engagement and conversions across our features. That's material changes for such a small change, why wouldn't you do it? (Hint: because it's typically not viewed as challenging or complex 🤯)

It all comes down to understanding how users interact with our products. As Steve Krug puts it in "Don't Make Me Think, Revisited," users scan, not read. The key principles? Clarity (making it easy for users to understand), simplicity (keeping things straightforward), and consistency (maintaining a cohesive experience). And if you have to choose between clarity and consistency, always go for clarity!

Another gem from Krug's book: there's no such thing as an average user. That's where personalization comes in. Netflix nailed this with their artwork personalization (check out their tech blog post! [1]). By tailoring content to individual users, they created a more engaging experience for everyone.

So, how can you harness the power of copy experiments in your own products? Start by identifying key touchpoints where users engage with text - headlines, CTAs, descriptions, you name it. Then, craft variations that focus on clarity and simplicity. Don't be afraid to get creative and test out different approaches! (You can also consider emojis, images, navigational layouts, etc.!)

The results might just surprise you. So start testing, and you might be amazed by the impact on your engagement and conversion rates!

Famous copy experiments:

1. Highrise's headline test: 37Signals tested variations of their headline and found that "Start a Highrise account" outperformed "30-day free trial on all accounts" by 30%! [2]
2. Movexa's headline test: By changing their headline messaging, Movexa increased purchases by a whopping 90%! [3]

These experiments show the power of small copy changes. They're a testament to the fact that even the most minor tweaks can yield significant results.
