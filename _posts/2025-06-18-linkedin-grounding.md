In a world spinning faster by the day, the only thing I truly control is myself.

The tech landscape shifts beneath our feet—layoffs, AI disrupting entire industries, startup booms and busts seemingly overnight. It's easy to feel powerless when your job security or career path suddenly looks uncertain.

We waste precious energy trying to predict market changes or control organizational decisions beyond our influence. I've learned that detaching from these external forces doesn't mean indifference—it's about strategic investment of limited resources.

When faced with industry turbulence, I focus on what I can influence: heads down and building, developing adaptable skills, nurturing my professional network, maintaining a financial safety net, and choosing my response to setbacks.

This mindset shift transformed my relationship with change. Instead of anxiety about organizational hurdles or potential layoffs, I concentrate on continuing to land impact and be resilient enough to thrive if anything unfortunate should happen anyway.

In professional settings, this means accepting volatile conditions while choosing my own response. In personal growth, it means becoming my own source of validation rather than seeking it from unstable external structures.

The world will keep spinning at its own pace. The question is: how will you direct your energy in the face of changes you can't control?
