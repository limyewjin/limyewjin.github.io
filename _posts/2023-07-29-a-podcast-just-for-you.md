Imagine starting your day with a tailored podcast, containing summarized stories from various newspapers and websites that you care about. With advances in LLMs and Text-to-Speech, it is now possible to automate this process.

Here are sample podcasts created for a "tech user in the Bay Area" on July 29, 2023.

## Hacker News

<a href="/assets/txt/hacker_news_podcast_jul_27_23.txt" target="_blank">Download the transcript for the hacker news sample podcast</a>

## New York Times

By leveraging AI technologies like OpenAI's GPT-4 for content curation and summarization, and ElevenLabs' text-to-speech for converting the script into a podcast, we can automate the process of creating personalized podcasts. It's an exciting time to explore the possibilities of AI in customizing and enhancing our consumption of online content.
