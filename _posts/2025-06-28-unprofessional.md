description: Creating connection through humor in the workplace
---

People sometimes ask why I bring my own kettle to work and hold impromptu "tea times" for whoever is at the microkitchen. Or why I can't resist sharing bad jokes in meetings ("Why did the hipster burn his mouth on the pizza? He ate it before it was cool." ðŸ˜«).

The truth? I never bought into the idea that being professional meant being serious. In fact, when I joined Google years ago, it was practically encouraged to be not serious. So I never developed the mindset where we abandon laughter to appear mature. Meanwhile, I was the one stacking bottles at my desk or providing constant quips in meetings.

Over time I have realized that my "unprofessional" approach is actually strategic. Here's proof which I got via Google's new AI Mode - When we laugh together, our brains release dopamine and oxytocin - the same chemicals that enhance problem-solving and build trust.

That joke before a meeting? I'm helping everyone's brains shift into creative problem-solving mode. Those spontaneous tea times? They build trust through tiny, consistent connections - building connections slowly over time. Interesting how what I did naturally might actually be a "strategic workplace culture activity" (that's going into my performance review writeup).

My philosophy is to create fun and not to force funny (because I would fail anyway). When your workplace becomes somewhere people want to be, laughter follows naturally.

Here's a challenge for you at work: Practice "Yes, and..." thinking. Accept reality (yes, this deadline is tight) AND find opportunity (this is our chance to change our product direction) AND YET we can do it with levity ("Great, more material for my next stand-up!")

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to brew some earl grey tea... â˜•
