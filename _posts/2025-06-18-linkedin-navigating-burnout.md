Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_avoiding-burnout-ive-been-reflecting-on-activity-7300392136984645632--uhm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

Avoiding burnout. I've been reflecting on my relationship with productivity and rest, and realize that it's tied to burnout if I'm not careful to take time off for myself.

The constant pressure to achieve more, do more, and be more is exhausting. It's exhausting us collectively.

The truth is, our bodies and minds aren't designed for constant productivity. What we often mistake as "laziness" is actually our natural signal that we need to slow down and recover. These signals aren't weaknesses—they're essential feedback we should honor.

I find that the path to avoiding burnout is remarkably simple yet profoundly difficult in our achievement-oriented culture: give yourself permission to rest. Not as a reward for working hard, but as a fundamental necessity. I always make sure to do side projects that are just silly and meaningful for me to play in.

For example, as a fun side project to disconnect from work pressure, I've been experimenting with figuring out LLM techniques to generate genuine dad jokes. Not the forced, AI-typical attempts, but authentic groaners that sound human-made. Below are some AI-generated examples using my approach:

- Why are kings great at measuring things? Because they're born rulers!
- I tried to quit my job at the glue factory... but they made me stick around.
- My pen is still single. It gets nervous around permanent markers.
- Why does Batman love dusk? Because that's when the light starts to Wayne.

Why do I spend time on this? Because playful creativity without pressure is exactly what helps me avoid burnout. Because why not?

Setting boundaries around your time and energy isn't selfish—it's what I find allows me to maintain my mental health over the long term.
