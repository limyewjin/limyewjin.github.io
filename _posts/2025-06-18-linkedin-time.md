description: Reflections on time's limitations - why we can't do everything with our 80,000 working hours and 4,000 weeks, and how scarcity creates intentional living.

I've been thinking a lot about time lately, and the implications of (the lack of) it.

We live in the future; AGI is arguably being built as we live and breathe, and ASI is around the corner. With such powerful tools emerging, it's easy to fall into the trap of believing we can do it all. Technology promises to help us squeeze more into each day, respond faster, and never miss an opportunity. But here's what I've come to realize: we can't do everything, and that's not just okay – it's liberating.

Consider this: most of us will have about 80,000 working hours in our entire careers (see 80000hours.org), and 4,000 weeks in our lifetime. That's it. When you look at it that way, every hour becomes precious. Every "yes" to one thing is inherently a "no" to something else.

This reality has transformed how I approach both work and life. Instead of maintaining the illusion of "doing it all," I'm learning to:

Make time for what matters NOW, not "someday." That project you're passionate about? That skill you want to master? That relationship you want to nurture? The time is now.

Set boundaries on commitments. I used to pride myself on juggling multiple projects simultaneously. Now I recognize that depth often matters more than breadth. Doing fewer things better has become my north star. In fact, I like to do one thing at a time.

Embrace the discomfort of prioritization. Every time we choose to focus on one thing, we're choosing not to focus on others. This can feel uncomfortable – we're hardwired to want to keep our options open. But I've found that accepting this discomfort leads to better decisions and more meaningful work.

Stay adaptable. Our priorities and circumstances will shift – that's inevitable. What matters is building the resilience to navigate these changes while staying true to what's most important to us.

This perspective has been transformative. Instead of constantly chasing the myth of "having it all," I'm finding more satisfaction in being intentional about how I spend my limited time. It's not about getting everything done – it's about getting the right things done.

And hey, if you've read this far, that's about 2 minutes of your 4,000 weeks. I hope it was worth it!
