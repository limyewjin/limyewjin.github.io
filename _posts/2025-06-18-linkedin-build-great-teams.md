Build Great Teams: The Secret to Long-Term Impact
In my previous posts, we explored building concentric circles of competency, starting with Know Thyself and mastering Problem-Solving. Today, we arrive at the third step: Build Great Teams.

No significant achievement in tech happens in isolation. Whether you're a manager or an IC, your impact is amplified by the strength of the team around you. Here are three pillars for building and being part of a winning team:

1. Build the Right Culture
   Culture isn't just a buzzwordâ€”it's the foundation of every high-performing team. A strong culture aligns people around shared values and creates psychological safety.

As a manager, I deliberately share the _worst_ brainstorming idea. Why? It sets the tone that we should be discussing ideas and work together to build something great. And we get there by working on diamond in the rough ideas -- by putting the bad ideas out there, I am giving license to folks to contribute their better ideas!

As an IC, I've been the one who steps up to document processes or present tech talks. The things that help lift the tide for the rest of the team.

We are the team's culture - how do we want to show up?

(And yes, OTOH, I have the _best_ bad jokes! ðŸ˜‰)

2. Hire and Retain the Right People
   The best teams are greater than the sum of their parts. For managers, it's about finding the right fit, not just talent. For ICs, you influence team composition through interviews and welcoming new members.

I've always welcomed new folks, regardless of role. Currently, I have a "tea-time" ritual where I brew extra cups and invite others: "hey, would you like a fresh cup of tea?" These small gestures create connections that make a team feel like home.

3. Collaborate for Success
   "If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."

Success in tech requires more than individual brillianceâ€”it demands collaboration. Managers should create systems enabling teamwork and celebrating collective wins. ICs can actively share knowledge and give credit where it's due.

As a manager, this means being very intentional on who and how you want to reward teammates for good work. As a wise friend always says: "It's all about the incentives"

One of my favorite collaboration examples? Our most impactful projects often started with a simple "Hey, what if we..." conversation over that cup of tea or lunch, bringing together different perspectives that turned a good idea into a great solution.

Building great teams isn't just about achieving goalsâ€”it's about creating an environment where people love to work. Whether you're a manager or an IC, you're part of the team's success story.

What small gestures or rituals have you found effective in building strong teams?
