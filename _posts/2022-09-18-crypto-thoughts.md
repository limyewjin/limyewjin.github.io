description: #cryptocrash trending on Twitter as I write this

As I am writing this blog post \#cryptocrash is tredning on Twitter. ETH is at $1300 and BTC is at $18,800. This isn't looking good to say the least, but I figure I will write down my thesis as a matter of financial discipline.

- ETH. Long-term bullish. Short-term confused.
- BTC. Store of value.
- APE. Yuga Labs ecosystem. Ugh on staking for ApeCoin.
- NFTs - buy the bluechips. Leave it along.
  - Yuga Labs: BAYC, Punks, Otherside, MAYC, BAKC. In that order.
  - Moonbirds
  - Nouns?
