description: Trading Money for Time - Thoughts on Stepping Away
---
I wrestled a long time with a decision that's been consuming my thoughts: should I retire early from Google? 

My parents are aging. They're still here, thankfully, but each visit reveals a new fragility, a slower step, another medication added to their daily routine. Mum basically can't travel to the US anymore so any visit will need to be me traveling over to Singapore. My eldest is heading to college soon - how did that happen so fast? The youngest still has homework battles and a childhood that won't wait for me to have more time "someday."

So here I am, typing out these thoughts. I may never publish this, but I need to work through the decision somehow. The irony isn't lost on me - I have spreadsheets and financial models telling me I can retire, but my heart and mind are still catching up to what the numbers say. The agony is made up but real.

## The Two Books That Changed My Perspective

In my quest to understand if early retirement is even possible (and wise), I've been devouring financial independence content. Two books in particular have shaped my thinking: "[The Simple Path to Wealth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30646587-the-simple-path-to-wealth)" by JL Collins and "[Die with Zero](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52950915-die-with-zero)" by Bill Perkins.

Let me be honest: "Die with Zero" is a terrible title. When I first saw it, I thought it was about reckless spending or living paycheck to paycheck in retirement. But the book is actually about something much more profound - rethinking your relationship with money and time. A better title might have been "Don't Trade Time You Don't Have for Money You Don't Need" (though I guess that's why I'm not a book editor).

These two books seem contradictory at first glance. Collins advocates for aggressive saving, living below your means, and investing in low-cost index funds until you reach financial independence. Perkins warns against dying with unspent money and missing out on life experiences while you're young and healthy enough to enjoy them. But together, they form a complete philosophy: build wealth efficiently so you can buy your freedom, then actually use that freedom while you can still enjoy it.

## The Practical Side: Getting Confidence in the Numbers

### Understanding the 4% Rule (and Why I Don't Trust It)

"The Simple Path to Wealth" talks a lot about the Trinity Study and the famous "4% rule." In 1998, three professors looked at historical market data and concluded that if you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in year one, then adjust for inflation each year after, you'd have a 95% chance of not running out of money over 30 years.

Sounds great, right? Here's the catch: I'm not planning a 30-year retirement. If I retire now, we're potentially talking 50+ years. The success rates drop significantly. Some updated studies suggest 3.5% or even 3.25% for longer retirements.

This is where the tech geek and working with math kicks in. I can build models and stress-tested scenarios. I basically can do that before breakfast. I read every [Early Retirement Now](https://earlyretirementnow.com/safe-withdrawal-rate-series/) post on safe withdrawal rates.

### Tracking Every Dollar (Or: Another thing that is in the same equivalence class as doing taxes)

To know if I could actually retire, I needed to understand our real expenses. Not the "I think we spend about..." version, but the actual reality.

Enter [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com/referral/u88korpu0x). After Mint died (RIP), I tried a bunch of alternatives. Monarch stuck because it actually works. It connects to all our accounts. Every transaction flows into one place where I can categorize, tag, and analyze our spending patterns.

Yes, I hate that I know what we spend annually. Bay Area living isn't cheap, especially with kids.

### Net Worth Tracking

For net worth, I use [Kubera](https://kubera.com). Why? Because I have a mess of accounts scattered everywhere - old 401(k)s, IRAs at Vanguard, some crypto, RSUs, our house. Kubera actually connects to all of it and shows me one number: what we're worth.

Is it worth $150/year? Honestly, I could probably do this in a spreadsheet. But I don't. Having it automated means I actually look at it monthly instead of good intentions that never happen. Plus, it handles the house value through Zillow, which saves me from obsessively checking home prices (I still do it, just less).

The moment I knew we could retire was anticlimactic. Just another Monday morning, coffee in hand, checking Kubera. Total net worth: $XX million. Our FIRE number (annual expenses รท safe withdrawal rate): $YY million. We'd crossed the line and I hadn't even noticed.

### The FIRE Math That Actually Matters

Here's a hypothetical scenario that got me to where I needed to be:

**Annual Expenses**: $120,000
**Safe Withdrawal Rate**: 3.5% (conservative for a long retirement)
**Required Portfolio**: $120,000 รท 0.035 = $3.43 million
**Buffer**: $670,000
**"Safe" Portfolio**: ~$4.1 million

That buffer helps me sleep at night. Markets crash. Roofs leak. Kids decide they want to go to expensive colleges. Life happens.

## Healthcare: The Thing Everyone Asks About

"But what about health insurance?" - literally everyone when I mention early retirement.

The ACA marketplace in California is actually... expensive but manageable? Looking at real numbers for our family of 5, we're staring at $2,000-2,800/month for decent coverage (Silver/Gold plans). That's with subsidies at higher income levels.

The trick is income optimization. Keep your taxable income low through Roth conversions and tax planning (more on this below), and those subsidies can be substantial. At $100K income, the subsidies nearly double. At $60K? You're looking at coverage that rivals corporate plans in affordability.

Is it as good as Google's insurance? No. But it's not the bankruptcy-inducing nightmare everyone warns about either. It's a solvable problem with a monthly price tag - just another line item in the FIRE budget.

## Testing the Waters

I took 2+ weeks off to test retirement. My family called it "vacation." I called it "reconnaissance."

Feeling guilty for reading a book at 10 AM on a Tuesday.

By week two, something shifted. I found myself:
- Teaching my youngest math and also some programming
- Having actual conversations with my parents instead of rushed phone calls
- Cooking elaborate meals
- Building terrible Arduino projects
- Not knowing what day it was (Tuesday? Thursday? Who cares?)

Was it perfect? No. But it was... peaceful. Present. The opposite of my normal life where I'm always thinking three meetings ahead.

## The One More Year Syndrome

Here's the trap: once you have enough, it's easier to keep working than to stop. There's always a reason for "one more year":
- GSUs vesting (golden handcuffs are real)
- Interesting project launching
- Team depending on you
- Economy looking shaky
- Or simply: this is what I know how to do

Every year I stay is a year I can't get back. A year my parents get older. A year closer to my kids leaving home. A year of trading time I don't have for money I don't need.

## What Would I Actually Do?

My unglamorous list:
- Be the dad who does more with kids
- Travel to Singapore and have breakfast with mum
- Get good at gardening (current survival rate: 30%)
- Build random stuff with Arduino/Raspberry Pi
- Build random AI stuff with AI
- Actually read the books I keep buying
- Cook without watching the clock

## The Courage Gap

The math says I can retire. The spreadsheets agree (and I have many spreadsheets). But there's a gap between knowing and doing.

Who am I without my Google badge? Without my title? Without the Tuesday 9 AM staff meeting?

I don't know yet. But I'm starting to think that's the point. To find out.

## Final Thoughts

Writing this helped, even if it never sees the light of day. The numbers work - I've checked them obsessively. Healthcare is manageable. The only missing piece is courage.

That phrase keeps rattling around my head: "Don't trade time you don't have for money you don't need."

My parents won't be around forever. My kids are growing up at warp speed. My knees already complain about hiking too much. Time isn't waiting for my spreadsheets to get more perfect.

I think I know what I'm choosing. The math says go. My gut says go. Now I just need my courage to catch up.
