Master Problem-Solving: The Key to Career Growth
In my previous posts, I outlined a framework for building concentric circles of competency, starting with Know Thyself. Today, let’s dive into the second step: Master Problem-Solving.

Problem-solving isn’t just about quick fixes. It’s about deeply understanding challenges, crafting thoughtful solutions, and building systems that prevent recurring issues.

1. Take Ownership
   Ownership is the foundation of great problem-solving. It’s about seeing yourself not just as a participant but as an agent of change.

Taking ownership isn’t also just about accountability—it’s about learning. Every problem, whether technical or organizational, is an opportunity to grow your skills, build trust, and demonstrate leadership.

Early in my career, I realized that managers and peers don’t know what you can do unless you step up. To be honest, my initial ideas were often naïve—or just plain bad. But by taking the lead on projects, I learnt hard lessons and yet when the ideas did work I demonstrated that I could get things done. Over time, I became recognized as the person who helps get things done. I also learnt when it mattered what _not to do_ (can be just as important as knowing what to do!) - hint: don't panic and always carry a towel

2. Identify the Core Problem
   Not all problems are equal. The visible challenge is often just the tip of the iceberg. Stay curious and ask why repeatedly to uncover the root cause. For example:

- Why is p99 latency bad?
- High RPC latency.
- Why?
- Too much unnecessary data and inefficient network calls!

(Anybody else always surprised by how much compute/latency is eaten up by RPCs?!)

This process can be humbling—it forces you to confront complexities—but it’s essential for finding the root cause and creating meaningful solutions. Often in Big Tech, these issues arise due to tech debt or just oversight with a large number of folks working at the same time in the codebase.

Also note that you can separate this root cause finding from the immediate bandaids one applies when you have an emergency!

3. Evaluate Solutions
   Come up with approaches and weigh trade-offs:

- What will this cost in time, effort, and resources? (Pick two!)
- What benefits will it deliver?
- How sustainable is it?

Remember: perfect is the enemy of done. Progress and iteration often lead to the best outcomes.

Problem-Solving: The Reward
Solving problems isn’t just a skill—it’s deeply fulfilling. Whether debugging code or improving processes, turning chaos into clarity builds your career and grows you as a leader.

Why this matters: Your performance and impact in Big Tech are directly tied to your ability to solve problems.

Problem-solving is the great differentiator. It’s what transforms a good contributor into a great one, an engineer into a leader, and an idea into impact.
