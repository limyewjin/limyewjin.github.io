Note to the reader: This is a [repost](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_as-an-engineering-director-i-used-to-think-activity-7310544134568562688-f7cV?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os) from LinkedIn

As an engineering director, I used to think that a goal is to train myself to juggle multiple priorities simultaneously. Then I realized something: my multitasking wasn't a strength—it was diluting my impact.

Here's how I've transformed my leadership approach with this in mind:

1. Choose ONE strategic priority daily (60-90 minutes): Whether it's diving deep into decisions for a flagship product, crafting our strategic roadmap, or working on a technical problem. My day-to-day norm is to be pulled in countless directions—choosing a daily focus creates compound impact over time.

2. Create focus-friendly zones:

- Dedicated "focus time" blocked on my calendar
- Replaced recurring status meetings with asynchronous updates
- Collaborating with my team on my week's focus to align calendars accordingly

3. Build sustainable energy practices:

- Daily walks to clear mental space
- Unscheduled "tea time" to recharge as needed

When I focus on a single strategic priority each day, I get things done and help unblock others. I find that it's useful to do this but it takes a conscious effort and intention to take control of your time and focus.

In this age of scattered attention, this might be our most important responsibility.

What's your strategic focus today?
