Well, I‚Äôve found the same holds true for mechanical pencils. And after years of frustration with lead-leaking pencils staining my clothes and stabbing me through my pockets, I found my perfect everyday companion a while back and finally got arond to touting it: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pentel-Mechanical-Pencil-Kerry-P1035-AD/dp/B0013NE3VA">Pentel Sharp Kerry</a></p> <p>Let me back up a bit. Like many of us, I‚Äôve had a love-hate relationship with mechanical pencils. While Wirecutter <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-mechanical-pencils/">crowned</a> the Blick Premier as their top pick (and it‚Äôs indeed an excellent pencil), I found my perfect match in their ‚ÄúAlso great‚Äù pick: the Pentel Sharp Kerry. It solves the one problem that matters most to me - it has a cap. Simple, right? But this isn‚Äôt just any cap. The designers at Pentel clearly spent some serious time thinking about how people actually use their pencils.</p> <p>Here‚Äôs what makes it special: you can click the lead even with the cap posted on the back. Sounds minor, but it‚Äôs a game-changer. They even spring-loaded the cap‚Äôs finial (that‚Äôs the fancy word for the end bit) so it doesn‚Äôt rattle around when capped or separated from the pencil. It‚Äôs one of those small details that makes the whole thing feel premium.</p> <p>But my favorite part? The dual-purpose design of the eraser and lead chamber. When you‚Äôre writing with the cap posted on the back, pop off the end finial and you‚Äôve got easy access to the eraser. Not using the pencil? Cap it, and that same removable end reveals the lead chamber for refills. It‚Äôs clever engineering that actually makes sense in daily use.</p> <p>The Kerry isn‚Äôt trying to be the fanciest mechanical pencil out there. Instead, it focuses on being reliable and practical. The 0.5mm lead writes smoothly, and the whole thing feels solid without being heavy. Plus, when you‚Äôre actually writing, you can rotate the pencil to get the sharpest part of the lead on the paper without the pocket clip getting in your way.</p> <p>Is it perfect? Maybe not. But it‚Äôs the first mechanical pencil I‚Äôve actually wanted to carry with me every day. And isn‚Äôt that what really matters? Because just like that camera in your phone, the best mechanical pencil is absolutely the one you‚Äôll actually have with you when you need it.</p> <p>And for me, that‚Äôs the Kerry. No more lead-stained pockets. No more accidentally stabbing myself. Just a reliable writing tool that‚Äôs ready when I am. Sometimes the best solutions are the simplest ones - even if it took a ton of pencil evolution and testing on my part to get there.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I tried a lot of mechanical pencils; this is the one I use and why]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Quick Prompt Engineering Tip 1 - Chain Your Prompts! üîÑ</title><link href="https://limyewjin.github.io/blog/2024/llm-tutorial-1/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Quick Prompt Engineering Tip 1 - Chain Your Prompts! üîÑ"/><published>2024-11-24T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-11-24T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://limyewjin.github.io/blog/2024/llm-tutorial-1</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://limyewjin.github.io/blog/2024/llm-tutorial-1/"><![CDATA[<p>The saying goes, ‚ÄúWriting is rewriting.‚Äù The same applies to LLMs!

I have done a few tests to share some key insights for controlling length in LLMs.</p> <h1 id="response-text-length">Response Text Length</h1> <ul> <li>‚ÄúAt Most X Words‚Äù What surprised me most was how consistently the ‚Äúat most X words‚Äù format outperformed other approaches. While exact word counts tend to overshoot by 10-15%, the ‚Äúat most‚Äù modifier acts like a reliable ceiling. In our tests, the various models from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI consistently stayed under the specified limit.</li> </ul> <p>A Practical Framework for Length Control:</p> <ol> <li>For Strict Upper Bounds: Use ‚Äúat most X words‚Äù - it‚Äôs your most reliable tool across all models. I‚Äôve found this especially crucial for applications with strict space constraints.</li> <li>For Minimum Length Requirements: The ‚Äúat least X words‚Äù modifier works, but expect significant variations. In our tests, outputs ranged from 119 to 238 words for a 100-word minimum requirement. If you need longer content, this is actually a feature, not a bug.</li> <li>Avoid Common Pitfalls:</li> </ol> <ul> <li>Qualitative descriptors (‚Äúshort,‚Äù ‚Äúvery short‚Äù) showed the highest variance in our tests</li> <li>Reading time estimates (‚Äú30 seconds long‚Äù) proved surprisingly inconsistent</li> <li>The format of numbers (‚Äú100‚Äù vs ‚Äúone hundred‚Äù) doesn‚Äôt significantly impact results</li> </ul> <h1 id="bullet-points">Bullet Points</h1> <p>As you might expect, using ordered lists (e.g., 1., 2., 3., ‚Ä¶) works better than unordered, but really only for longer lists.

The journey from early game-playing algorithms to today‚Äôs multifaceted AI systems is nothing short of extraordinary.</p> <h3 id="the-game-changing-progression">The Game-Changing Progression</h3> <p>The evolution of game AI tells a fascinating story of human ingenuity. We started with simple minimax algorithms and alpha-beta pruning, techniques that seemed cutting-edge at the time. Then came knowledge-based systems, leveraging human expertise to improve performance.</p> <p>A significant leap during my PhD was the advent of Monte Carlo methods, particularly Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This probabilistic approach opened new horizons, allowing AI to handle the vast complexity of games like Go.</p> <p>In fact, the impact of MCTS on the field was so profound that it accelerated my own academic journey. I was deep into my PhD research on forward pruning and selective search in game-tree search when MCTS emerged. It quickly became clear that complete game-tree search might not be the future of game AI. This realization prompted me to swiftly wrap up my research into a PhD thesis. The last paragraph of my PhD thesis reflects this pivotal moment:</p> <blockquote> <p>The game of Go can be considered as the grand challenge of game AI at this point in time. One interesting development in computer Go has been the introduction of Monte Carlo methods that combine game-tree search and randomly generated moves for evaluation [Coulom, 2006, Kocsis and Szepesv√°ri, 2006]. The random nature of Monte Carlo methods corresponds well with the theoretical analysis of the properties of forward pruning presented in this thesis, and should extend to Monte Carlo tree search. More research on how to incorporate risk management strategies in forward pruning can be done to further improve the state of the art for Monte Carlo tree search.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>Looking back, it‚Äôs remarkable how accurate this assessment was. MCTS indeed became a cornerstone in advanced game AI, particularly in conquering the game of Go.</p> <p>But the true revolution came with the integration of deep learning. Neural networks, once considered a relic of AI‚Äôs past, roared back to life. They brought with them the ability to learn complex patterns and strategies from raw data. This culminated in the creation of AlphaGo, a system that shocked the world by defeating Lee Saedol, one of the greatest Go players of our time.</p> <p>Yet, AlphaGo was just the beginning. AlphaGo Zero and then AlphaZero demonstrated that AI could learn superhuman strategies without any human knowledge, purely through self-play. The implications were staggering.</p> <h3 id="beyond-the-game-board">Beyond the Game Board</h3> <p>What truly excites me is how these game-playing techniques have found applications far beyond the world of board games. Let me share some cutting-edge examples:</p> <h4 id="weather-forecasting">Weather Forecasting</h4> <p>The advancements in game AI have found significant applications beyond the game board, one of which is weather forecasting. Google‚Äôs MetNet-3<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> leverages techniques reminiscent of those used in game AI to tackle the complexities of atmospheric dynamics. By integrating the data assimilation and simulation processes into a single neural network pass, MetNet-3 can provide high-resolution weather predictions up to 24 hours ahead, covering variables such as precipitation, temperature, wind, and dew point. This model outperforms traditional physics-based numerical weather prediction methods, achieving temporal resolutions as fine as two minutes and spatial resolutions of one to four kilometers.</p> <h4 id="drug-discovery">Drug Discovery</h4> <p>In the realm of drug discovery, AI techniques refined in game-playing applications are accelerating research and development. Insilico Medicine‚Äôs AI-generated drug for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a prime example. Their AI system, which includes platforms like PandaOmics and Chemistry42, identified a novel therapeutic target (TNIK) and designed a small molecule (INS018_055) for IPF treatment in just 18 months, a process that traditionally takes years. This AI-driven approach mirrors game AI‚Äôs method of identifying key strategic points and developing optimal strategies to exploit them. The rapid progression of this AI-designed drug, now in Phase 2 clinical trials, underscores the potential of AI in pharmaceutical research.</p> <h4 id="molecular-biology">Molecular Biology</h4> <p>In molecular biology, the impact of AI is profoundly illustrated by AlphaFold 3<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, which extends the capabilities of its predecessor by predicting the structure and interactions of a wide range of biological molecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules. This progression from predicting protein structures to modeling complex molecular interactions showcases the significant leap in AI‚Äôs application in biology. AlphaFold 3‚Äôs enhanced architecture, featuring an improved Evoformer module and a diffusion network, has achieved a substantial improvement in the accuracy of predicting protein interactions, further advancing our understanding of cellular biology.</p> <h3 id="the-common-thread">The Common Thread</h3> <p>What fascinates me most is the common thread running through all these applications ‚Äì the ability of AI to learn complex patterns and make decisions in high-dimensional, uncertain environments. Whether it‚Äôs navigating the vast possibility space of Go, predicting chaotic weather systems, or exploring the intricate world of molecular structures, AI is proving to be a powerful tool.</p> <h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3> <p>As we stand at this exciting juncture, I can‚Äôt help but wonder: what‚Äôs next? Which field will see the next AlphaZero-like breakthrough? How might these AI techniques reshape your industry?</p> <p>One thing is certain ‚Äì we‚Äôre not just spectators in this AI renaissance. We‚Äôre potential collaborators, innovators, and pioneers. The games AI has learned to play have prepared it for the greatest game of all ‚Äì advancing human knowledge and capabilities across all fields of endeavor.</p> <p>I‚Äôm eager to hear your thoughts.

All those users flooding the site will see the deals and go wild!</p> <p>But wait, what about the email and notifications team? Shouldn‚Äôt they be crafting personalized updates and maybe even more exclusive deals for engaged users? And what about marketing? Are they on the same page with messaging, or will users get confused by mixed signals?</p> <p>In big companies, this kind of coordination doesn‚Äôt happen automagically. Teams often optimize for their own little fiefdoms without seeing the bigger picture.</p> <p>Now, decentralizing growth efforts is usually the secret to scaling.

When there‚Äôs a tidal wave of users expected, like during Black Friday or the World Cup, it‚Äôs time to yell (figuratively!) and get all hands on deck.</p> <p>At the end of the day, growth is a team sport.

This point is crucial because it emphasizes the importance of being humble and adaptable in the face of real-world feedback. As the Mike Tyson famously once said, ‚ÄúEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face.‚Äù In my team I like to say: ‚ÄúEveryone has a Growth plan until they run their first live experiment.‚Äù</p> <p>It‚Äôs easy to fall in love with our own product vision and believe that we know exactly what our users need. However, the reality is that our assumptions are often wrong or incomplete. Only by putting our products in front of real users and gathering feedback can we truly understand what works and what doesn‚Äôt.</p> <p>Be humble. This doesn‚Äôt mean abandoning our vision altogether, but rather being open to tweaking and refining it based on real-world insights. The most successful products are those that strike a balance between a strong vision and a willingness to iterate based on user feedback.

I have thought more than I care to admit about the key principles and strategies that can help unlock sustainable growth - here they are:</p> <h1 id="small-g-and-big-g-growth-is-not-growth">small g and big G: growth is not Growth</h1> <ul> <li>Pick which g/G refers to what, then stick with it.</li> <li>‚Äúgrowth‚Äù (small g) refers to the repeatable approach of optimizing the growth funnel: acquisition, churn resurrection, engagement, retention, and churn reduction.</li> <li>‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù (big G) acts on the core value proposition and requires product-market fit.</li> <li>It‚Äôs crucial for organizations to understand and prioritize both aspects, ensuring that ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù efforts align with the overarching ‚ÄúGrowth‚Äù strategy.</li> </ul> <h1 id="hope-is-not-a-good-growth-strategy">Hope is not a (good) growth strategy</h1> <ul> <li>Unfortunately just because it‚Äôs not a good strategy doesn‚Äôt stop people from using it</li> <li>Relying on hope alone is a common pitfall that many organizations fall into, often leading to disappointment and wasted resources.</li> <li>Successful growth requires a data-driven approach, clear goals, and a well-defined strategy backed by actionable plans and metrics.</li> <li>While hope can provide motivation, it should not be the foundation of a growth strategy.</li> </ul> <h1 id="its-all-about-the-funnel-funnel-funnel">It‚Äôs all about the funnel funnel funnel</h1> <ul> <li>The growth funnel is a fundamental concept that governs the success of any product or service.</li> <li>It‚Äôs math - it governs the world - please deal with it. I am not trying to throw shade at your product.</li> <li>Small changes that impact a large audience at the top of the funnel can often yield better results than big changes targeting a smaller slice of traffic.</li> <li>Organizations must prioritize and focus on the most critical stages of the funnel to maximize their growth efforts.</li> </ul> <h1 id="growth-is-launch-and-iterate">growth is launch and iterate</h1> <ul> <li>Ideal: 70% ‚Äúcore‚Äù / 30% opportunity</li> <li>The 70/30 rule emphasizes the importance of focusing primarily on the core mission (70%) while leaving room for opportunistic initiatives (30%).</li> <li>Launching quickly and iterating based on user feedback and data insights allows for faster learning and adaptation.</li> <li>Being agile and open to pivoting when necessary is crucial in today‚Äôs fast-paced market.</li> </ul> <h1 id="theory-folks-dont-understand-how-to-think-about-growth-until-their-neck-is-on-the-line-for-growth">Theory: Folks don‚Äôt understand how to think about growth until their neck is on the line for growth</h1> <ul> <li>People only truly grasp the importance of growth when they are directly accountable for it.</li> <li>It highlights the need for organizations to align incentives and create a culture where everyone feels responsible for growth.</li> <li>Encouraging a growth mindset across the organization can lead to more innovative ideas and collaborative efforts towards achieving growth targets.</li> </ul> <h1 id="growth-portfolio-management">Growth Portfolio management</h1> <ul> <li>Effective growth requires a balanced approach to resource allocation.</li> <li>Prioritize and fund proven growth levers before exploring unknown or experimental initiatives to ensure more predictable and reliable growth.</li> <li>Maintain a balance and allocate some resources to high-potential, innovative ideas that could become future growth drivers.</li> </ul> <p>Embracing a growth mindset is essential for success in the big tech industry and beyond. By understanding the difference between ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù and ‚ÄúGrowth,‚Äù leveraging the power of the funnel, and adopting a balanced approach to resource allocation, organizations can unlock sustainable growth and stay ahead of the curve. Remember, growth is not just about tactics; it‚Äôs a mindset that requires continuous learning, experimentation, and adaptation.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="tutorial"/><category term="growth"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to execute on growth]]></summary></entry></feed>
