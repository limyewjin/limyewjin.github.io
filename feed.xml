But here’s what actually limited my career: spending years saying yes to everything that looked like “career growth” while my actual work - the creative stuff that energized me - and family time happened in stolen moments late at night (or even late night weekends!)</p> <p>Then I realized that I was living someone else’s definition of success. The “visibility projects”, the various committees I joined, the OKRs planning meetings that went nowhere. Meanwhile, I was exhausted and clearly not thriving, even burning out on multiple occasions as I’ve shared in previous posts.</p> <p>I now have three simple rules:</p> <ol> <li>If it consistently drains me, I stop</li> <li>If I’m doing it to impress someone, I question it</li> <li>If it doesn’t get calendar time, it doesn’t exist</li> </ol> <p>That last one might be interesting. Values without calendar blocks are just motivational poster material. Now my “focus” blocks are as real and important as meetings to execute on projects. My Friday afternoon mentoring sessions? Non-negotiable.</p> <p>Aligning with your values isn’t just about finding yourself - it’s about being disciplined enough to follow through. This is why scheduling yourself matters. When you treat your real priorities like actual appointments, something shifts. The gap between who you want to be and who you are starts closing.</p> <p>Try this for yourself: Block one hour for something you claim matters but never “have time” for. Guard it like a critical meeting with your VP. Because it is.</p> <p>Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s dinner time with the family…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="linkedin"/><category term="mentalhealth"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tips to live an aligned life]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">FAANG Engineers Should Rethink Their Investment Strategy</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/faang-investment-strategy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="FAANG Engineers Should Rethink Their Investment Strategy"/><published>2025-08-10T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-08-10T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/faang-investment-strategy</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/faang-investment-strategy/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR: A seven-figure W-2 is a great springboard - but unless you trade some of that paycheck for ownership, the ceiling stays capped.</strong></p> <p>Picture this: you’re a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer (L70) pulling in $2.7M a year. You’ve hit the IC summit. You dutifully max every tax shelter, funnel the rest into index funds, and - just as <a href="https://x.com/deedydas/status/1950741701439750167">Deedy Das’ comp slide</a> predicts - retire 30 years later with $13M.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/ScreenShot-deedy-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/ScreenShot-deedy-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/ScreenShot-deedy-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/ScreenShot-deedy.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="50%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <p>This is supposed to be the pinnacle of the “known” path to wealth. The safe, guaranteed route that every FAANG engineer aspires to.</p> <p>Now I’m not so sure about this path. I believe FAANG Engineers and other high-wage earners can do better.</p> <h2 id="the-bogleheads-gospel-at-work"><strong>The Bogleheads Gospel at Work</strong></h2> <p>Having spent many years in FAANG, I watched the same financial planning playbook repeat across internal forums and water cooler chat: max your 401(k), dump everything else into broad index funds, mega backdoor Roth, max out the HSA. The messaging was consistent - save 30% of your high six-figure or seven-figure income and you’ll hit $10M eventually. It’s the safe, responsible path.</p> <p>This conventional wisdom dominated my work circles. When RSUs hit like clockwork every month or quarter, the advice was always the same: diversify immediately into VTSAX. Anyone suggesting individual stocks or angel investing was met with links to that one study about how 90% of day traders lose money.</p> <p>But here’s what bothered me: we were all brilliant engineers solving complex problems at work, yet we’d outsource our entire financial future to Vanguard and follow the Bogleheads philosophy religiously. The mindset became “take your bets at work, don’t risk the golden goose.”</p> <h2 id="two-views-one-message"><strong>Two Views, One Message</strong></h2> <p>Before we dive into numbers, notice the hidden premise both camps share: it’s not how much you earn, it’s what you own. One path treats salary as an endgame; the other treats it as rocket fuel. The difference sounds philosophical, but the outcomes can be material.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Source</th> <th>What the math says</th> <th>What it really means</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Microsoft comp leak</td> <td>Save 30% of L57-L70 pay → $13M in 30 years</td> <td>After taxes &amp; inflation: $5-7M in today’s dollars</td> </tr> <tr> <td><a href="https://www.financialsamurai.com/the-richest-people-are-not-index-fund-fanatics/">Financial Samurai article</a></td> <td>Typical $30M+ portfolios</td> <td>Only ~7% sits in index funds - the rest is business equity &amp; real estate</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>W-2 income - even seven figures - has a ceiling.

And if California’s proposed 14.63% top bracket passes? Sharpen the blade.</p> <p><strong>Time-for-Money Trap</strong>: Your comp pauses when you take a sabbatical. Your roommate’s SaaS revenue or equity in a company doesn’t. The higher your salary, the scarier it feels to unplug - so you rarely do. I watched peers who could easily chubbyFIRE or leanFIRE stay chained to their desks because they couldn’t quite hit fatFIRE on index funds alone.</p> <p><strong>The Diversification Paradox</strong>: Your FAANG colleagues preach “don’t concentrate,” yet the richest people did exactly that - then diversified. Think Bezos keeping 90% Amazon until the yacht was paid for.</p> <p><strong>Bottom line: A supersized paycheck is defensive wealth. Ownership is offensive wealth. You need both, but only one can win a championship.</strong></p> <h2 id="the-selection-bias-problem"><strong>The Selection Bias Problem</strong></h2> <p>There’s probably selection bias at play here - the types who join and stay at FAANG already chose the “safe” path. We’re the ones who picked the stable job over the startup, the guaranteed comp over equity lottery tickets. Plus, when you’re working 60+ hours chasing that next promo, there’s barely mental energy left to research asymmetric bets.</p> <p>But that’s exactly the trap. We optimize for the wrong thing - maximizing W-2 income instead of maximizing ownership potential.</p> <h2 id="two-kinds-of-rich"><strong>Two Kinds of “Rich”</strong></h2> <p>We toss “rich” around like it’s binary, but lived experience says otherwise.</p> <p><strong>The Comfortably Rich ($1-10M)</strong></p> <ul> <li>Dual-income professionals, 20+ years in tech</li> <li>70%+ in index funds</li> <li>Nice house, Premium Economy flights</li> <li>Still fret over college tuition &amp; healthcare</li> </ul> <p><strong>The Transformational Rich ($10M+)</strong><br/> When you hit eight figures, what you own shifts radically - per Financial Samurai’s reader surveys:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Net worth</th> <th>Business equity</th> <th>Real estate</th> <th>Public stocks*</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>$30M</td> <td>30%</td> <td>30%</td> <td>20% (~7% index funds)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>$300M</td> <td>40%</td> <td>20%</td> <td>15%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>*Public-stock slices often include concentrated founder shares - not a three-fund portfolio.</p> <p><strong>Index funds preserve wealth; concentrated equity creates it</strong>. Nick Maggiulli’s “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wealth-Ladder-Proven-Strategies-Financial/dp/0593854039">Wealth Ladder</a>” framework puts this in stark perspective. He defines wealth in six levels, each a 10x jump from the last. Level 4 ($1M-$10M) gives you “travel freedom” - you can vacation wherever you want. Level 5 ($10M-$100M) provides “house freedom” - your dream home becomes possible without impacting your finances.</p> <p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: even if you hit that Microsoft L70 comp and save religiously for 30 years, you’ll likely land squarely in Level 5 but just barely - most will end up in Level 4. The traditional FAANG-and-index-funds path has a ceiling, and that ceiling sits below Level 5.</p> <p>To break into Level 5 and beyond requires something different - concentrated ownership that can compound beyond what any salary, no matter how astronomical, can deliver. The gap between Level 4 and Level 5 isn’t bridged by saving another 10% or getting one more promotion. It’s bridged by ownership.</p> <p><strong>My Asymmetric Wealth Playbook (The 90/10 Rule)</strong>. Here’s the framework I wish someone had shown me earlier: if you’re earning FAANG-level comp, you can easily save your 30% for that “guaranteed” retirement AND still have serious capital left over for asymmetric bets.</p> <p><strong>The 90/10 Split:</strong></p> <ul> <li>90% goes to the traditional path (401k, index funds, mega backdoor Roth)</li> <li>10% of gross income goes to asymmetric bets</li> </ul> <p>At senior levels, that 10% could be $200K+ annually. Write $25K checks for angel investments, small rentals, or side projects. Over 30 years, that’s 80-100 bets. Even if all but one goes to zero and the last one goes 100x, that winner pays for everything. This is literally the VC model - power law returns where one unicorn makes the entire portfolio.</p> <p><strong>The Three Phases:</strong></p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Fuel the Rocket</strong> - Keep W-2 cash flowing; save 30-60%. Think of this as stacking solid rocket boosters.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Light the Booster</strong> - Direct that 10% into asymmetric bets while salary covers the downside: angel checks, small rentals, nights-and-weekends SaaS.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Stabilize the Orbit</strong> - When something hits, harvest gains (QSBS, 1031 exchanges), then add index funds for wealth preservation so market swings don’t rip your solar panels off.</p> </li> </ol> <p>If every bet zeros, fine - I’m still on pace for $13M at 60. If even one wins, I punch through the income ceiling that salary alone could never breach.</p> <h2 id="real-world-patterns-financial-samurai-readers"><strong>Real-World Patterns (Financial Samurai Readers)</strong></h2> <p>Here are a few real-life examples shared by readers in the Financial Samurai community:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Starting point</th> <th>Concentrated move</th> <th>Outcome</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Google L5</td> <td>$200K seed into a friend’s startup (Uber)</td> <td>$40M at IPO</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Meta PM</td> <td>Four Bay-Area rentals, 75% LTV</td> <td>$5M equity in 10 years</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Amazon SDE</td> <td>Side-hustle SaaS → $50K MRR</td> <td>Sold for $15M</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong>Common thread: They kept the day job until upside was real. Salary was a risk-buffer, not the prize.</strong></p> <h2 id="the-psychology-of-swinging-big"><strong>The Psychology of Swinging Big</strong></h2> <p>The hard part isn’t finding opportunities - it’s rewiring a high-earning brain conditioned to equate stability with virtue. When RSUs hit like clockwork, risk looks irresponsible. But:</p> <ul> <li>Getting laid off at 55 with golden handcuffs? Also irresponsible.</li> <li>Missing the window to exercise creativity (and mistakes) while energy is high? Same.</li> <li>Outsourcing your richest years to Vanguard and hoping the Bogleheads were right? You get the idea.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Caveat:</strong> Asymmetry isn’t YOLO. It’s capped-downside, uncapped-upside. If a single busted deal torpedoes your retirement, you bet wrong. The beauty of the 90/10 split is that your downside is truly capped - worst case, you still retire with $10M+ from your index funds.</p> <h2 id="bottom-line"><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2> <p>Index funds preserve wealth; concentrated equity creates it.</p> <p>A FAANG paycheck is rare rocket fuel - but only if you pour some of it into rockets you actually own. Otherwise you’re just leasing horsepower and calling it freedom.</p> <p>The conventional Bogleheads wisdom isn’t wrong - it’s just incomplete. Yes, max that 401(k). Yes, build that index fund foundation. But once the defensive lines are drawn, ask yourself:</p> <p><strong>What slice of my future is still on offense?</strong></p> <p>The answer - not your salary - will decide whether you retire comfortable or transformational.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="retirement"/><category term="financialplanning"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trade some paycheck for ownership]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Be Unprofessional at Work</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/unprofessional/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Be Unprofessional at Work"/><published>2025-06-28T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-28T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/unprofessional</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/unprofessional/"><![CDATA[<p>People sometimes ask why I bring my own kettle to work and hold impromptu “tea times” for whoever is at the microkitchen. Or why I can’t resist sharing bad jokes in meetings (“Why did the hipster burn his mouth on the pizza? He ate it before it was cool.” 😫).</p> <p>The truth? I never bought into the idea that being professional meant being serious. In fact, when I joined Google years ago, it was practically encouraged to be not serious. So I never developed the mindset where we abandon laughter to appear mature. Meanwhile, I was the one stacking bottles at my desk or providing constant quips in meetings.</p> <p>Over time I have realized that my “unprofessional” approach is actually strategic. Here’s proof which I got via Google’s new AI Mode - When we laugh together, our brains release dopamine and oxytocin - the same chemicals that enhance problem-solving and build trust.</p> <p>That joke before a meeting? I’m helping everyone’s brains shift into creative problem-solving mode. Those spontaneous tea times? They build trust through tiny, consistent connections - building connections slowly over time. Interesting how what I did naturally might actually be a “strategic workplace culture activity” (that’s going into my performance review writeup).</p> <p>My philosophy is to create fun and not to force funny (because I would fail anyway). When your workplace becomes somewhere people want to be, laughter follows naturally.</p> <p>Here’s a challenge for you at work: Practice “Yes, and…” thinking. Accept reality (yes, this deadline is tight) AND find opportunity (this is our chance to change our product direction) AND YET we can do it with levity (“Great, more material for my next stand-up!”)</p> <p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to brew some earl grey tea… ☕</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="softwareengineering"/><category term="mentalhealth"/><category term="workplaceculture"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creating connection through humor in the workplace]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Doing Nothing is Something</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/do-nothing/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Doing Nothing is Something"/><published>2025-06-28T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-28T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/do-nothing</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/do-nothing/"><![CDATA[<p>Ever notice how “What are you working on?” is a default small talk opener?</p> <p>We’ve created a world where every moment needs to be monetized, optimized, or leveraged for future gain.

His framework of Software 1.0 (hand-coded) → 2.0 (neural nets) → 3.0 (natural language) captures something profound - these aren’t successive replacements but complementary tools in our expanding toolkit. This is augmentation, not abdication of our intelligence.</p> <p>The reality check is sobering: ignore the hype and realize that while LLMs are powerful, they still need a tight leash. They hallucinate, mix facts randomly, and require careful guardrails. “Vibe coding” is magical for weekend prototypes and personal projects, but becomes risky in production environments. It’s prone to cascading bugs, security vulnerabilities, and mounting technical debt. As many are discovering, it’s both mentally exhausting and somewhat overhyped for serious development - often coding itself into a corner and require fundamental rewrites when productionizing.</p> <p>This is fine since what Karpathy (and others like myself) really advocate for is augmented intelligence - think Iron Man’s suit enhancing human capabilities, not replacing them. We’re moving toward human-in-the-loop systems with adjustable autonomy sliders, where AI amplifies our abilities rather than operating independently. The practical approach? Use AI to rapidly prototype and explore ideas, but stay deeply engaged to review, test, and iterate. Those ambiguous LLM outputs demand structured pipelines with human verification at critical junctures.</p> <p>So what should we do now?</p> <p>For early-career engineers: practice “supervised vibe coding” - generate small functions with AI but trace through every line to understand the logic. Mid-level engineers: use LLMs as architectural rubber ducks and for boilerplate reduction, but own the design decisions. Senior engineers: create AI-safe architectures where generated components can fail gracefully, and establish team guidelines for responsible AI usage. Everyone should maintain a “playground” environment for AI experiments, separate from production.</p> <p>And if you are a product builder, the question becomes: how do we make augmentation the centerpiece of your product? What does it mean to be not human-first, not AI-first, but human-AI-first?</p> <p>This crystallizes what remains irreplaceable: human judgment, ethics, creativity, and the ability to navigate ambiguity - precisely where AI struggles most. The future belongs to those who master human-AI orchestration, combining clear architectural vision with creative judgment. We need to be amplified by AI yet firmly anchored in human insight and understanding.</p> <p>Bottom line: AI won’t replace developers who understand their craft, but those who can do this dance between the technical and human will define the next era. The skill to develop isn’t just coding - it’s orchestrating AI capabilities while knowing when human wisdom is non-negotiable.</p> <p>Learn to conduct the symphony, not just play an instrument. Enjoy the wave.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai"/><category term="softwareengineering"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections on Karpathy's AI manifesto and why the future belongs to human-AI orchestrators]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Coping with Burnout</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-burnout-practices/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coping with Burnout"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:42+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-burnout-practices</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-burnout-practices/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_its-been-a-few-weeks-since-i-posted-and-activity-7329206012123455489-AyGn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>It’s been a few weeks since I posted and I wanted to share strategies that help me cope with not burning out while still valuing the work - AI continues to be moving at a fast pace and there is so much for us to get plug in and be part of the future!</p> <ul> <li> <p>For me, a crucial first step has been identifying what delights versus what drains me.

I’ve been noticeably absent from posting recently, and I want to be transparent about why: I’ve been experiencing burnout.</p> <p>Thankfully, I caught it early.

This became clearer to me during my PhD and has continued throughout my career as a software engineer. I am often the one who comes up with the “crazy ideas” that make people tilt their heads… mostly they don’t work but sometimes they do, and they’re always fun to explore! There is also a neat psychological trick of giving others the permission to say their “crazy ideas” once there are already other (dumb) crazy ideas out there.</p> <p>I’ve been reflecting on where these insights come from, and I’ve recognized distinct patterns:</p> <ul> <li>When I question the assumptions that everyone else takes for granted. Those moments when I ask “Why do we always do it this way?” or “Does this constraint actually exist?” have led to some of my best breakthroughs. Sometimes what seems like an immovable limitation is just a habit we’ve never challenged.</li> <li>When I make unexpected connections between ideas. Some of my strongest contributions came from bringing together concepts from different domains—like when I applied Web spelling correction to document spelling correction. Sure the style of writing is different, but the underlying tech feels like they should be transferrable, plus the Web spelling correction system is automagically updated with new words!</li> <li>When conventional approaches don’t work, it means we have to try new things. Innovative solutions have emerged when the standard playbook failed completely and we had no choice but to explore outside our comfort zone. These moments of being forced to abandon the familiar have often led to our most elegant solutions. I would say that doing a PhD really forces one in this space, after all, your goal is do something which no one else has done before!</li> <li>Be willing to try ideas, even though this is a balance as I can’t try everything, and so I had to build an intuition over time of how much to push here, but as they say, “In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.”</li> </ul> <p>Not all my ideas work out—plenty crash and burn spectacularly. But I’ve learned that being open to pursuing these insights, even when they seem risky, has made me a better software engineer and problem-solver.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="linkedin"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How questioning assumptions, making unexpected connections, and trying unconventional approaches leads to breakthrough solutions that others might miss.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intuition</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-intuition/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intuition"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:39+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:39+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-intuition</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-intuition/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_as-software-engineers-we-pride-ourselves-activity-7311595226978992129-2yVD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>As software engineers, we pride ourselves on being data-driven and making totally rational decisions. But there’s an underrated tool in our toolkit: intuition.</p> <p>Apologies if I offend your sensibility here, but there is so much to us and the world, and there is a mysterious power to our subconscious mind. Our unconscious mind constantly processes information at a scale our conscious mind cannot match. It detects subtle patterns, synthesizes seemingly unrelated data points, and makes rapid assessments based on years of accumulated experience.</p> <p>That’s why I’ve learned to trust my gut on softer decisions:</p> <ul> <li>When something feels “off” about a product direction</li> <li>When a teammate’s stated concerns doesn’t align with intuitive concerns</li> <li>When a team restructuring looks good on paper but doesn’t feel right</li> </ul> <p>Our unconscious mind processes social cues, nonverbal signals, and complex patterns that analytics often miss. These “gut feelings” aren’t random - they’re our brain’s sophisticated pattern-recognition system at work.</p> <p>However, intuition of course has its limits. I would be cautious when relying on it in an unfamiliar domain (your unconscious needs data to work with), strong emotions are clouding judgment (fear, excitement, attachment), or using it in situations which require precise quantitative analysis.</p> <p>The best decisions often come from balancing analytical thinking with intuitive wisdom. My approach: listen to my gut, but verify with data when possible. Also work with teammates who aren’t afraid to tell you your decision is dumb. :-)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="linkedin"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why software engineers should trust their intuition for softer decisions while understanding its limits, and how the unconscious mind processes complex patterns.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Strategic Focus</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-strategic-focus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Strategic Focus"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:38+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-strategic-focus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-strategic-focus/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_as-an-engineering-director-i-used-to-think-activity-7310544134568562688-f7cV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>As an engineering director, I used to think that a goal is to train myself to juggle multiple priorities simultaneously.
