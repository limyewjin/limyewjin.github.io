Or why I can’t resist sharing bad jokes in meetings (“Why did the hipster burn his mouth on the pizza? He ate it before it was cool.” 😫).</p> <p>The truth? I never bought into the idea that being professional meant being serious. In fact, when I joined Google years ago, it was practically encouraged to be not serious. So I never developed the mindset where we abandon laughter to appear mature. Meanwhile, I was the one stacking bottles at my desk or providing constant quips in meetings.</p> <p>Over time I have realized that my “unprofessional” approach is actually strategic. Here’s proof which I got via Google’s new AI Mode - When we laugh together, our brains release dopamine and oxytocin - the same chemicals that enhance problem-solving and build trust.</p> <p>That joke before a meeting? I’m helping everyone’s brains shift into creative problem-solving mode. Those spontaneous tea times? They build trust through tiny, consistent connections - building connections slowly over time. Interesting how what I did naturally might actually be a “strategic workplace culture activity” (that’s going into my performance review writeup).</p> <p>My philosophy is to create fun and not to force funny (because I would fail anyway). When your workplace becomes somewhere people want to be, laughter follows naturally.</p> <p>Here’s a challenge for you at work: Practice “Yes, and…” thinking. Accept reality (yes, this deadline is tight) AND find opportunity (this is our chance to change our product direction) AND YET we can do it with levity (“Great, more material for my next stand-up!”)</p> <p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to brew some earl grey tea… ☕</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="softwareengineering"/><category term="mentalhealth"/><category term="workplaceculture"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creating connection through humor in the workplace]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Software 3.0 - Learn to Conduct, Not Just Code</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/developer-dance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Software 3.0 - Learn to Conduct, Not Just Code"/><published>2025-06-26T08:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-26T08:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/developer-dance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/developer-dance/"><![CDATA[<p>Having watched Andrej Karpathy’s latest talk “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCEmiRjPEtQ">Software Is Changing (Again)</a>” - it’s not just a technical update, it’s a fundamental shift in how we think about building software. His framework of Software 1.0 (hand-coded) → 2.0 (neural nets) → 3.0 (natural language) captures something profound - these aren’t successive replacements but complementary tools in our expanding toolkit. This is augmentation, not abdication of our intelligence.</p> <p>The reality check is sobering: ignore the hype and realize that while LLMs are powerful, they still need a tight leash. They hallucinate, mix facts randomly, and require careful guardrails. “Vibe coding” is magical for weekend prototypes and personal projects, but becomes risky in production environments. It’s prone to cascading bugs, security vulnerabilities, and mounting technical debt. As many are discovering, it’s both mentally exhausting and somewhat overhyped for serious development - often coding itself into a corner and require fundamental rewrites when productionizing.</p> <p>This is fine since what Karpathy (and others like myself) really advocate for is augmented intelligence - think Iron Man’s suit enhancing human capabilities, not replacing them. We’re moving toward human-in-the-loop systems with adjustable autonomy sliders, where AI amplifies our abilities rather than operating independently. The practical approach? Use AI to rapidly prototype and explore ideas, but stay deeply engaged to review, test, and iterate. Those ambiguous LLM outputs demand structured pipelines with human verification at critical junctures.</p> <p>So what should we do now?</p> <p>For early-career engineers: practice “supervised vibe coding” - generate small functions with AI but trace through every line to understand the logic. Mid-level engineers: use LLMs as architectural rubber ducks and for boilerplate reduction, but own the design decisions. Senior engineers: create AI-safe architectures where generated components can fail gracefully, and establish team guidelines for responsible AI usage. Everyone should maintain a “playground” environment for AI experiments, separate from production.</p> <p>And if you are a product builder, the question becomes: how do we make augmentation the centerpiece of your product? What does it mean to be not human-first, not AI-first, but human-AI-first?</p> <p>This crystallizes what remains irreplaceable: human judgment, ethics, creativity, and the ability to navigate ambiguity - precisely where AI struggles most. The future belongs to those who master human-AI orchestration, combining clear architectural vision with creative judgment. We need to be amplified by AI yet firmly anchored in human insight and understanding.</p> <p>Bottom line: AI won’t replace developers who understand their craft, but those who can do this dance between the technical and human will define the next era. The skill to develop isn’t just coding - it’s orchestrating AI capabilities while knowing when human wisdom is non-negotiable.</p> <p>Learn to conduct the symphony, not just play an instrument. Enjoy the wave.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="ai"/><category term="softwareengineering"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflections on Karpathy's AI manifesto and why the future belongs to human-AI orchestrators]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Coping with Burnout</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-burnout-practices/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Coping with Burnout"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:42+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:42+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-burnout-practices</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-burnout-practices/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_its-been-a-few-weeks-since-i-posted-and-activity-7329206012123455489-AyGn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>It’s been a few weeks since I posted and I wanted to share strategies that help me cope with not burning out while still valuing the work - AI continues to be moving at a fast pace and there is so much for us to get plug in and be part of the future!</p> <ul> <li> <p>For me, a crucial first step has been identifying what delights versus what drains me.

This became clearer to me during my PhD and has continued throughout my career as a software engineer. I am often the one who comes up with the “crazy ideas” that make people tilt their heads… mostly they don’t work but sometimes they do, and they’re always fun to explore! There is also a neat psychological trick of giving others the permission to say their “crazy ideas” once there are already other (dumb) crazy ideas out there.</p> <p>I’ve been reflecting on where these insights come from, and I’ve recognized distinct patterns:</p> <ul> <li>When I question the assumptions that everyone else takes for granted. Those moments when I ask “Why do we always do it this way?” or “Does this constraint actually exist?” have led to some of my best breakthroughs. Sometimes what seems like an immovable limitation is just a habit we’ve never challenged.</li> <li>When I make unexpected connections between ideas. Some of my strongest contributions came from bringing together concepts from different domains—like when I applied Web spelling correction to document spelling correction. Sure the style of writing is different, but the underlying tech feels like they should be transferrable, plus the Web spelling correction system is automagically updated with new words!</li> <li>When conventional approaches don’t work, it means we have to try new things. Innovative solutions have emerged when the standard playbook failed completely and we had no choice but to explore outside our comfort zone. These moments of being forced to abandon the familiar have often led to our most elegant solutions. I would say that doing a PhD really forces one in this space, after all, your goal is do something which no one else has done before!</li> <li>Be willing to try ideas, even though this is a balance as I can’t try everything, and so I had to build an intuition over time of how much to push here, but as they say, “In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not.”</li> </ul> <p>Not all my ideas work out—plenty crash and burn spectacularly. But I’ve learned that being open to pursuing these insights, even when they seem risky, has made me a better software engineer and problem-solver.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="linkedin"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How questioning assumptions, making unexpected connections, and trying unconventional approaches leads to breakthrough solutions that others might miss.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Intuition</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-intuition/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Intuition"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:39+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:39+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-intuition</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-intuition/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_as-software-engineers-we-pride-ourselves-activity-7311595226978992129-2yVD?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>As software engineers, we pride ourselves on being data-driven and making totally rational decisions. But there’s an underrated tool in our toolkit: intuition.</p> <p>Apologies if I offend your sensibility here, but there is so much to us and the world, and there is a mysterious power to our subconscious mind.

These “gut feelings” aren’t random - they’re our brain’s sophisticated pattern-recognition system at work.</p> <p>However, intuition of course has its limits. I would be cautious when relying on it in an unfamiliar domain (your unconscious needs data to work with), strong emotions are clouding judgment (fear, excitement, attachment), or using it in situations which require precise quantitative analysis.</p> <p>The best decisions often come from balancing analytical thinking with intuitive wisdom. My approach: listen to my gut, but verify with data when possible. Also work with teammates who aren’t afraid to tell you your decision is dumb. :-)</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="linkedin"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why software engineers should trust their intuition for softer decisions while understanding its limits, and how the unconscious mind processes complex patterns.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Strategic Focus</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-strategic-focus/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Strategic Focus"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:38+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:38+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-strategic-focus</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-strategic-focus/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_as-an-engineering-director-i-used-to-think-activity-7310544134568562688-f7cV?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>As an engineering director, I used to think that a goal is to train myself to juggle multiple priorities simultaneously.

Last week during a 3-day training program, I made a choice that would have felt impossible to me years ago: I opted out of the elective modules to simply rest and reflect–to be fair, that was an option presented which make the choice obvious to me since it was clear that I needed it.</p> <p>In our achievement-oriented culture, there’s a persistent myth that our worth is tied to our productivity. This false belief suggests that if we’re not constantly doing, we’re somehow failing or being lazy.</p> <p>What I’m learning, particularly as I’ve gotten older, is that the urge to slow down isn’t laziness at all – it’s a biological signal worth listening to. There’s a clarity that comes with age and experience about when to push and when to pause. Perhaps this is part of where the saying “Youth is wasted on the young” is getting at.</p> <p>When we’re constantly giving our all to our jobs, side projects, and responsibilities, we leave no space for deep thinking, creativity, or even understanding who we truly are.</p> <p>I find that I can only sustain focused productivity for a few hours daily. Working beyond that point often leads to diminishing returns and, eventually, burnout. Yet somehow, society has normalized the expectation of constant productivity with terms like “996” which refers a work schedule in China where employees are expected to work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week, or 60+ hour work weeks.</p> <p>This reminds me of the concept of “lying flat” (“tang ping” in Mandarin) or “quiet quitting” which describes personal rejections of societal pressures to overwork and over-achieve.</p> <p>Perhaps it doesn’t need to be this way, that our work can sustainable, productive, even joyful.</p> <p>This weekend, I’m breaking my usual pattern. No side projects. No getting ahead for next week. Just rest. I’m sharing this because I suspect I’m not alone in struggling with the guilt that comes with choosing recovery.</p> <p>In my twenties, I might have pushed through, worn the exhaustion like a badge of honor. Now I recognize that was never sustainable or even effective. But what if creating space for ourselves isn’t self-indulgence but necessary maintenance? What if resting isn’t the opposite of productivity but a crucial component of sustainable achievement? Perhaps this is the wisdom that comes with experience – understanding that our energy is finite and worthy of protection.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="linkedin"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why choosing rest over constant productivity isn't laziness but necessary maintenance, and how slowing down can lead to more sustainable achievement.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">GenAI Defining Moment</title><link href="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-genai-defining/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="GenAI Defining Moment"/><published>2025-06-18T08:00:35+00:00</published><updated>2025-06-18T08:00:35+00:00</updated><id>https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-genai-defining</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://yewjin.com/blog/2025/linkedin-genai-defining/"><![CDATA[<p>Note to the reader: This is a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/yewjinlim_ive-been-thinking-about-defining-moments-activity-7305723154549653504-q0SU?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAD4xmMBhqAf0RkmEot2NJkJA3gvq31H7Os">repost</a> from LinkedIn</p> <p>I’ve been thinking about defining moments lately - those experiences that shape who we are and what we become.</p> <p>As I watch the AI revolution unfold, I can’t help but be reminded of when I first joined Google in 2007, thinking that I missed the boat with the whole “make information universally accessible” dream.

We’re shaping it.</p> <p>Ten, maybe even just five or less, years from now, we’ll look back at this period with 20/20 clarity.
